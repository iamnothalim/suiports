🌊 SuiPORTS

AI-powered SocialFi Prediction Platform for Breaking Sports News
From breaking news → AI scoring → official prediction markets

🚀 Overview

SuiPORTS is a Web3-native AI + SocialFi platform that transforms breaking sports news into prediction markets.
Users can freely propose events, AI scores them for credibility, relevance, and timing, and only the highest-scoring events become official, tradable prediction products.

We start with football (축구) as our initial vertical, then expand to multi-sports, and finally to global prediction markets across politics, economy, entertainment, and more.
